It is the first day of New Moon. The sun rises above the horizon and shines it's light on TOWN.
TOWN is somewhere in Gavony. In Viddens Parish?

JOHN & RYAN, you are here to find more information on Bishop MINOR VILLIAN; a suspected accomplace 
to your family's destruction. Unfortunately, the trail seems to have grown cold and you must decide 
where to turn next. 

JON, you have been traveling with the NAME brothers for a while now. You and Shepherd PRIEST saw
this investigation as an opportunity to help root out sabatours or those who would otherwise
undermine the strength of the church. As the trail grows cold you wonder if you attention
would be better directed to more pressing threats to the church.

MATT, you are in TOWN for no real reason. You are drifting. You are at once, fiercely determined to
find those responsible for the destruction of your village and also rudderless, you lack the 
strength to avenge your home and the station to convince or order others to aid you. You ponder 
this thought as you ACTION TO INTRODUCE PLAYERS TO EACHOTHER.
