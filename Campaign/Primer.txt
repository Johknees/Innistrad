In Innistrad, horrors stalk the shadows and scratch at doors in the night. 
Humanity is beset on all sides: vampires thirst for human blood, werewolves 
live for the thrill of the hunt, the restless spirits of the dead haunt the living, 
and no corpse is safe from reanimation at the hands of cruel necromancers or cunning scientists. 
Only their grim determination—and their staunch faith in the protection of their patron archangel, Avacyn, 
has allowed humans to survive in this nightmarish realm.

All classes are acceptable choices. The primer pdf has ideas for each one.
In addition, I have marked specific ones that would fit the setting well (especially helpful for subclasses
released after the pdf was written).
I'm not familiar with every class/subclass, so it could still fit even if I don't mark it. 
Really, just avoid anything that deals directly with other planes.
