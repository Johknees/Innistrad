In Innistrad, horrors stalk the shadows and scratch at doors in the night. 
Humanity is beset on all sides: vampires thirst for human blood, werewolves 
live for the thrill of the hunt, the restless spirits of the dead haunt the living, 
and no corpse is safe from reanimation at the hands of cruel necromancers or cunning scientists. 
Only their grim determination—and their staunch faith in the protection of their patron archangel, Avacyn, 
has allowed humans to survive in this nightmarish realm.
