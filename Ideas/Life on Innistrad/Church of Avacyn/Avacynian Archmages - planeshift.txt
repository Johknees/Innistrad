The Avacynian archmages are gifted spellcasters with
the inborn ability to channel some of the divine power
of the archangels. Each lineage of the archmages practices
unique techniques passed down from master to
student for generations, ultimately tracing back to the
archangels and Avacyn herself.
Spearsages, the archmages of Goldnight, use powerful
and aggressive spells associated with the sun,
channeling blinding rays of holy light and powerful
prayers to bolster their allies’ speed and courage.
Moonsages, the archmages of Alabaster, are concerned
with preserving the Blessed Rest, preventing
humans from returning as zombies. They use preventative
and warding spells, banishing the undead to the
void and making sure graves remain sealed.
Springsages, the archmages of Herons, are healers
who use their magic to aid individuals, whole villages,
and even the land itself. They act much like wandering
priests or monks, traveling the remote reaches to
minister to the people and heal the sick.
Avacynian archmages might be clerics, wizards,
or (in the case of the springsages) druids. The favored
soul sorcerer presented in Unearthed Arcana could
also work for an archmage, and the sage background is
ideal for such characters.
