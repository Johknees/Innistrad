The church is headed by the Lunarch Council. 
Consisting of bishops and cathars of the highest ranks, 
the council continues to struggle to come to terms with the madness of Avacyn and her angels. 

Bishops are the leaders of the spiritual and temporal affairs of the church. 

Elders govern the parishes that make up each province, 
combining the administrative responsibilities of a mayor with the religious authority of a minor bishop. 

Priests attend to the needs of the people at parish churches, village chapels, and crossway altars. 

All priests have the ability to perform magic, though some are more powerful than others. 

Most of them focus on the protective blessings that make up the rituals of the church. 

Monks are wandering priests, not connected to a specific location. 

Some feel called to minister to those isolated people living beyond the reach of a parish priest, 
but others take up the life of a monk because they disagree with their superiors in the hierarchy. 
Some are wild-eyed fanatics or heretical teachers, 
but many are quiet, peaceful souls with firm convictions that set them apart from the church. 

A player character cleric is probably referred to as a monk in the church hierarchy, 
having the freedom to move around with no responsibility to any congregation. 

The acolyte background is ideal for such a character. 

A cleric’s choice of domain might reflect a connection to one of the archangels subservient to Avacyn. 

The Knowledge domain is particularly associated with Bruna and Flight Alabaster, 
the Life domain is strongly connected to Sigarda and the Host of Herons, 
and the War domain is tied to Gisela and Flight Goldnight.
