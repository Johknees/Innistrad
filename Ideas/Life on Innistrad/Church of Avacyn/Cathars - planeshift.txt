Cathars are the soldiers of the Avacynian church,
but "soldiers" is a broad term encompassing everything from crime-solving investigators to mounted paladins.

Some cathar orders are so independent as to be virtually separate sects of the church,
while others are tightly bound to the hierarchy of the faith:

- The elite cavalry of Innistrad, the Gavony Riders, are extensively trained in mounted combat with swords and lances. 

- The mausoleum guards are the rank-and-file soldiers of the cathars,
wielding little magic but making up for it with their numbers.

- Midnight duelists patrol the streets, particularly at night, on the lookout for thieves, vampires, and corpse traders.

- Moor chaplains are battlefield faithful who wield magic and weapons with equal skill. 
Their magic focuses on healing and protection, so they don’t usually fight on the front lines.

- Cathars of the parish-blades serve as escorts along the crossways and protect the cathedral in Thraben. 
They are an elite military force that assembles at the bishops’ command.

- The Quiver of Kessig is an order recently split off from the parish-blades.
Its members specialize in archery and long-range defense,
and often guard town walls and church roofs against spirits, vampires, specters, demons, and other flying attackers.

Cathar characters might be:
	clerics (especially moor chaplains),
	fighters or paladins (especially Gavony Riders, mausoleum guards, midnight duelists, or parish- blades),
	or rangers (in the Quiver of Kessig).

The soldier background works well for cathars.
