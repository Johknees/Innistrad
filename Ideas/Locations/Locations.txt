Four provinces.
    Kessig
        Life is work.
        Farmers/millers/weavers/stonemasons
        Live close to the land and work hard for every meal.
        Self-reliant, pragmatic, and plainspoken.
    Gavony
        Safe behind walls of the High City of Thraben
        Moors - behind shuttered windows/barred doors/grim determination
        most well rounded
    Nephalia
        Ever-present shroud of fog from the sea
        Bustling markets, till soggy earth, out to sea on small fishing boats
    Stensia
        Hardship, close proximity to vampire strongholds - lost children and neighbors
        Proud and fervent in their beliefs - seem brusque or cold to people from other provinces
